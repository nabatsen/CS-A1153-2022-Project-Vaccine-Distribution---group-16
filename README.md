# Project Vaccine Distribution
This repository provides a basic structure for collaborating with your teammates on project Vaccine Distribution. Read the following content carefully to understand the file structure as well as how to work with git and SQLite. 

## How to work with git

Here's a list of recommended next steps to make it easy for you to get started with the project. However, understanding the concept of git workflow and git fork is necessary and essential. 

-   [Create a fork of this official repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork)
-   [Add a SSH key to your gitlab account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account)
-   Clone the fork to your local repository
```
git clone git@version.aalto.fi<your-group-name>/project-vaccine-distribution.git
```
-   [Add a remote to keep your fork synced with the official repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#repository-mirroring)
```
git remote add upstream git@version.aalto.fi:cs-a1153_databases_projects/project-vaccine-distribution.git
git pull upstream main                                  # if the official repository is updated you must pull the upstream
git push origin main                                    # Update your public repository
```

## How to work with virtual environment
**MacOS/Linux - Method 1**
```
sudo apt-get install python3-venv           # Note: this cannot be used in Aalto VM due to the lack of sudo right. 
cd project-vaccine-distribution             # Move to the project root folder
python3 -m venv venv                        # Create a virtual environment 
source venv/bin/activate                    # Activate the virtual environment
(venv) $                                    # You see the name of the virtual environment in the parenthesis.
```

**MacOS/Linux - Method 2**
```
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv    # You can use virtualenv instead, if you are using Aalto VM.
cd project-vaccine-distribution             # Move to the project root folder
virtualenv venv                             # Create a virtual environment 
source venv/bin/activate                    # Activate the virtual environment
(venv) $                                    # You see the name of the virtual environment in the parenthesis.

```
**Windows**

You can install and create a virtual environment similar to the above. However, it should be noted that you activate the environment differently, as shown below. 
```
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
**Deactivate**  

You can deactivate the virtual environment with this command.
```
deactivate
```

## File structure
This section explains which file goes under which folder. It's important to upload your code and report to the right folder so that TAs can easily find them for grading.

1. **requirements.txt**

    In order to keep track of Python modules and packages required by your project, we provided a ```requirements.txt``` file with some starter packages required for data preprocessing. After activating the virtual environment, you can install these packages by running ```pip install -r ./code/requirements.txt```. Please add additional packages that you install for the project to this file. 

2. **(DEFAULT OPTION) SQLite database**

    Most SQL database engines are are client/server based such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc. Client/server SQL database engines strive to implement a shared repository of data. They support scalability, concurrency, centralization, and control. 
    
    SQLite is an serverless database. It is designed to provide **local data storage** for individual applications and devices. SQLite supports an unlimited number of simultaneous readers, but it will only allow one writer at any instant in time.
    
    Read more: [SQLite Is Serverless](https://sqlite.org/serverless.html) and [Appropriate Uses For SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html)

    In order to avoid git conflicts when multiple team members write to a shared database, it is advisable that each team member creates their own project database on local machine for testing. You can skip pushing the SQLite database to group repository by adding ```project_database.db``` file to ```.gitignore```. In development phase, you only need to push the code for creating and querying the database. The code updates will only affect your local database.

    Once there are no need to edit the database file, you can push it to group repository, under database folder. 
3. **(ADVANCED OPTION) PostgreSQL**

    Although A+ exercises and Group Projects can be done on SQLite, we offer PostgreSQL as an advanced alternative for students who want to learn more about client/server-based databases. This alternative is only for group projects. 
    
    PostgresSQL can have a different query syntax than SQLite. It's advisable for those who choose to work with PostgreSQL to browse thorugh the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) or watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4).
